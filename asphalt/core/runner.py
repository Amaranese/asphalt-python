    Configure logging and start the given root component in the default asyncio event loop.

    Assuming the root component was started successfully, the event loop will continue running
    until the process is terminated.

    Initializes the logging system first based on the value of ``logging``:
      * If the value is a dictionary, it is passed to :func:`logging.config.dictConfig` as
        argument.
      * If the value is an integer, it is passed to :func:`logging.basicConfig` as the logging
        level.
      * If the value is ``None``, logging setup is skipped entirely.

    By default, the logging system is initialized using :func:`~logging.basicConfig` using the
    ``INFO`` logging level.

    The default executor in the event loop is replaced with a new
    :class:`~concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` where the maximum number of threads is set to
    the value of ``max_threads`` or, if omitted, the default value of
    :class:`~concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`.

    :param component: the root component (either a component instance or a configuration dictionary
        where the special ``type`` key is either a component class or a ``module:varname``
        reference to one)
    :param event_loop_policy: entry point name (from the ``asphalt.core.event_loop_policies``
        namespace) of an alternate event loop policy (or a module:varname reference to one)
    :param max_threads: the maximum number of worker threads in the default thread pool executor
        (the default value depends on the event loop implementation)
    :param logging: a logging configuration dictionary, :ref:`logging level <python:levels>` or
        ``None``
    :param start_timeout: seconds to wait for the root component (and its subcomponents) to start
        up before giving up (``None`` = wait forever)
