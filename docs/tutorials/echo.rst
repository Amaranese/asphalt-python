Tutorial 1: Getting your feet wet â€“ a simple echo server and client
===================================================================

This tutorial will get you started with Asphalt development from the ground up.
You will be learn how to build a simple network server that echoes back messages sent to it, along
with a matching client application. It will however not yet touch more advanced concepts like
using the ``asphalt`` command to run an application with a configuration file.

Prerequisites
-------------

Asphalt requires Python 3.5.2 or later. You will also need to have the ``venv`` module installed
for your Python version of choice. It should come with most Python installations, but if it does
not, you can usually install it with your operating system's package manager (``python3-venv`` is a
good guess).

Setting up the virtual environment
----------------------------------

.. highlight:: bash

Now that you have your base tools installed, it's time to create a *virtual environment* (referred
to as simply ``virtualenv`` later). Installing Python libraries in a virtual environment isolates
them from other projects, which may require different versions of the same libraries.

Now, create a project directory and a virtualenv::

    mkdir tutorial1
    cd tutorial1
    python3.5 -m venv tutorialenv
    source tutorialenv/bin/activate

On Windows, the last line should be:

.. code-block:: doscon

   tutorialenv\Scripts\activate

The last command *activates* the virtualenv, meaning the shell will first look for commands in
its ``bin`` directory (``Scripts`` on Windows) before searching elsewhere. Also, Python will
now only import third party libraries from the virtualenv and not anywhere else. To exit the
virtualenv, you can use the ``deactivate`` command (but don't do that now!).

You can now proceed with installing Asphalt itself::

    pip install asphalt

Creating the project structure
------------------------------

Every project should have a top level package, so create one now::

    mkdir echo
    touch echo/__init__.py

On Windows, the last line should be:

.. code-block:: doscon

    copy NUL echo\__init__.py

Creating the first component
----------------------------

Now, let's write some code! Create a file named ``server.py`` in the ``echo`` package directory::

    from asphalt.core import Component, run_application


    class ServerComponent(Component):
        async def start(self, ctx):
            print('Hello, world!')

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        component = ServerComponent()
        run_application(component)

The ``ServerComponent`` class is the *root component* (and in this case, the only component) of
this application. Its ``start()`` method is called by ``run_application`` when it has
set up the event loop. Finally, the ``if __name__ == '__main__':`` block is not strictly necessary
but is good, common practice that prevents ``run_application()`` from being called again if this
module is ever imported from another module.

You can now try running the above application. With the project directory (``tutorial``) as your
current directory, do:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m echo.server

This should print "Hello, world!" on the console. The event loop continues to run until you press
Ctrl+C (Ctrl+Break on Windows).

Making the server listen for connections
----------------------------------------

The next step is to make the server actually accept incoming connections.
For this purpose, the :func:`asyncio.start_server` function is a logical choice::

    from asyncio import start_server

    from asphalt.core import Component, run_application


    async def client_connected(reader, writer):
        message = await reader.readline()
        writer.write(message)
        writer.close()
        print('Message from client:', message.decode().rstrip())


    class ServerComponent(Component):
        async def start(self, ctx):
            await start_server(client_connected, 'localhost', 64100)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        component = ServerComponent()
        run_application(component)

Here, :func:`asyncio.start_server` is used to listen to incoming TCP connections on the
``localhost`` interface on port 64100. The port number is totally arbitrary and can be changed to
any other legal value you want to use.

Whenever a new connection is established, the event loop launches ``client_connected()`` as a new
:class:`~asyncio.Task`. Tasks work much like `green threads`_ in that they're adjourned when
waiting for something to happen and then resumed when the result is available. The main difference
is that a coroutine running in a task needs to use the ``await`` statement (or ``async for`` or
``async with``) to yield control back to the event loop. In ``client_connected()``, the ``await``
on the first line will cause the task to be adjourned until a line of text has been read from the
network socket.

The ``client_connected()`` function receives two arguments: a :class:`~asyncio.StreamReader` and
a :class:`~asyncio.StreamWriter`. In the callback we read a line from the client, write it back to
the client and then close the connection. To get at least some output from the application, the
function was made to print the received message on the console (decoding it from ``bytes`` to
``str`` and stripping the trailing newline character first). In production applications, you will
want to use the :mod:`logging` module for this instead.

If you have the ``netcat`` utility or similar, you can already test the server like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    echo Hello | nc localhost 64100

This command, if available, should print "Hello" on the console, as echoed by the server.

Creating the client
-------------------

No server is very useful without a client to access it, so we'll need to add a client module in
this project. And to make things a bit more interesting, we'll make the client accept a message to
be sent as a command line argument.

Create the file ``client.py`` file in the ``echo`` package directory as follows::

    import sys
    from asyncio import open_connection

    from asphalt.core import CLIApplicationComponent, run_application


    class ClientComponent(CLIApplicationComponent):
        def __init__(self, message: str):
            super().__init__()
            self.message = message

        async def run(self, ctx):
            reader, writer = await open_connection('localhost', 64100)
            writer.write(self.message.encode() + b'\n')
            response = await reader.readline()
            writer.close()
            print('Server responded:', response.decode().rstrip())

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        component = ClientComponent(sys.argv[1])
        run_application(component)

You may have noticed that ``ClientComponent`` inherits from
:class:`~asphalt.core.component.CLIApplicationComponent` instead of
:class:`~asphalt.core.component.Component` and that instead of overriding the
:meth:`~asphalt.core.component.Component.start` method,
:meth:`~asphalt.core.component.CLIApplicationComponent.run` is overridden instead.
This is standard practice for Asphalt applications that just do one specific thing and then exit.

The script instantiates ``ClientComponent`` using the first command line argument as the
``message`` argument to the component's constructor. Doing this instead of directly accessing
``sys.argv`` from the ``run()`` method makes this component easier to test and allows you to
specify the message in a configuration file (covered in the next tutorial).

When the client component runs, it grabs the message to be sent from the list of command line
arguments (``sys.argv``), converts it from a unicode string to a bytestring and adds a newline
character (so the server can use ``readline()``). Then, it connects to ``localhost`` on port 64100
and sends the bytestring to the other end. Next, it reads a response line from the server, closes
the connection and prints the (decoded) response. When the ``run()`` method returns, the
application exits.

To send the "Hello" message to the server, run this in the project directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m echo.client Hello

Conclusion
----------

This covers the basics of setting up a minimal Asphalt application. You've now learned to:

* Create a virtual environment to isolate your application's dependencies from other applications
* Create a package structure for your application
* Start your application using :func:`~asphalt.core.runner.run_application`
* Use :ref:`asyncio streams <python:asyncio-streams>` to create a basic client-server protocol

This tutorial only scratches the surface of what's possible with Asphalt, however. The
:doc:`second tutorial <webnotifier>` will build on the knowledge you gained here and teach you how
to work with components, resources and configuration files to build more useful applications.
